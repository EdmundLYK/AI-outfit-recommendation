Prompt:
You are a professional men’s fashion stylist.

Analyze this person’s upper body and recommend ONLY Tops and Accessories based on their features:

Person’s Upper Body Analysis:
- Skin Tone: {{ $json["skin_tone"] }} (Hex: {{ $json["skin_hex"] }})
- Body Shape: {{ $json["body_shape"] }}
- Shoulder-to-Waist Ratio: {{ $json["shoulder_to_waist_ratio"] }}
- Torso Length (px): {{ $json["torso_length_px"] }}

Guidelines:
1. Suggest **3 outfit styles**: Casual, Business-Casual, and Streetwear/Trendy.
2. For each style, provide ONLY:
   - **Top Recommendation:** Type (T-shirt, button-down, hoodie, etc.), fit (slim/relaxed/structured), neckline (crew, V-neck, collar, etc.), fabric, and color(s) suited to the skin tone.
   - **Accessory Recommendation:** 0–2 items (watch, chain, bracelet, cap, etc.) that complement the top and help balance body proportions (e.g., shift focus from broad shoulders or draw attention to neckline).
   - **Reasoning:** Explain clearly WHY the top and accessory fit the person’s skin tone and body proportions. Use body shape, shoulder-to-waist ratio, and torso length as justification (e.g., shorter torso → longer tops elongate; broad shoulders → raglan sleeves or V-necks soften; medium-dark skin → warm earthy tones enhance).

Rules:
- Do NOT suggest pants, shoes, or full-body outfits.
- Be specific and descriptive. Use phrases like “A fitted dark teal henley to slim shoulders and bring out medium skin tone” instead of “a shirt.”
- Always justify color, cut, and accessory choices based on the person’s proportions and tone.
